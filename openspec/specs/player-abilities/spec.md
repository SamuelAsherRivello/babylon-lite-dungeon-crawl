# player-abilities Specification

## Purpose
Expose four reorderable abilities with clear positional key bindings, Mana costs, and consistent activation through keyboard and mobile controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Provide four positional ability bindings
Abilities SHALL contain four positions without group titles. Initially Heal SHALL occupy position 01 and offensive Wand position 02, with 03 and 04 empty. Keyboard keys 1–4 and matching mobile buttons SHALL activate the ability in the corresponding position. Empty positions SHALL not activate an action.

#### Scenario: Activate by position
- **WHEN** the player presses 1 with Heal in position 01
- **THEN** Heal is requested

#### Scenario: Press an empty binding
- **WHEN** the player presses 3 with position 03 empty
- **THEN** no action, Mana cost, message, or world tick occurs

### Requirement: Render ability rows and costs
Each populated ability SHALL appear as one full-width horizontal row in the order position number, ability icon, title, plain Mana cost, and drag icon. Filled rows SHALL use the Mana color family. Empty rows SHALL be drop targets with no text. Ability costs SHALL NOT have an additional Mana icon.

#### Scenario: Read Heal row
- **WHEN** Heal occupies position 01
- **THEN** its row reads as `[01] ability-icon Heal mana-cost drag-icon`

### Requirement: Disable abilities with insufficient Mana
An ability SHALL have a Mana cost. When current Mana is below that cost, its row and mobile activation button SHALL be greyed out and activation SHALL be rejected through all input paths without a message or world tick.

#### Scenario: Reject unaffordable ability
- **WHEN** the player presses a key or mobile button for an ability that costs more Mana than is available
- **THEN** the ability does not activate, Mana stays unchanged, and no user message is shown

### Requirement: Resolve affordable abilities as one action
An accepted ability SHALL deduct its Mana cost, apply its defined effect, and advance one time unit followed by one enemy phase. Heal SHALL restore Health within its maximum, and Wand SHALL provide offensive magic. Effect strength, cost, targeting range, and animation timing SHALL be configurable independently of slot binding.

#### Scenario: Cast an affordable ability
- **WHEN** an ability with a valid effect and target is activated with enough Mana
- **THEN** its cost is deducted once, its effect resolves once, and the world advances once

### Requirement: Reorder ability bindings through drag
The player SHALL be able to move an ability to an empty position or swap populated positions by drag. A committed reorder SHALL change the positional key bindings and cost one tick. Preview, cancellation, or return to the original position SHALL not change the bindings or time.

#### Scenario: Move Heal to another key
- **WHEN** Heal is committed from position 01 to position 04
- **THEN** key 4 activates Heal and position 01 becomes empty, with one time increment

#### Scenario: Swap abilities
- **WHEN** Heal and Wand exchange populated positions
- **THEN** their displayed numbers and key bindings exchange without changing their Mana costs
