# Game Layout and Pixel Art

Rogue's Dungeon supports fitted 16:9 landscape and 9:16 portrait viewports. Platform detection selects landscape on PC and portrait on mobile. Developers can preview either layout on PC during development; this override lasts only for the current page session and is not a player preference. The four template corner units are removed.

The landscape shell allocates 4% to the title, 92% to gameplay and information, and 4% to the status bar. Portrait allocates 4% to the title, 46% to the game, 4% to status, and 46% to a vertically scrollable lower area. Titlebar and statusbar contents are centered vertically. Mobile Controls appear first, followed by both information panels; no tab controls are rendered. Only Log, equipment Slots, and Inventory scroll internally. Controls include WASD and arrows for movement, Shift or right mouse for faster movement, C for Sneak, and 1–4 for abilities.

Zoom, Camera, and desired Fullscreen state are stored once per browser under `rogues-dungeon.preferences.v1`, separately from the three campaign slots. Defaults are 1x, Center, and windowed. If a saved Fullscreen intent cannot be restored automatically, selecting a Saved Game retries it during that user gesture. Actual Fullscreen state follows browser `fullscreenchange` events. Settings clears held movement, traps keyboard focus, supports Escape, and offers Save & Return, GitHub, and a non-clickable version label. Corrupt campaign slots are shown as unavailable and left intact rather than replaced.

World tiles and actor frames are 32 by 32 pixels. Native zoom keeps each tile at source dimensions; Half and Double use the template's render-resolution dimension calculation and preserve nearest-neighbor pixel edges. Supplied Tiled tilesets and example maps remain under `public/assets/` with their relative image paths intact.

The current turn model is in `src/game/dungeon.js`; slot persistence is in `src/game/saves.js`. Both are independent from the React display. The active view is assembled in `src/game/Game.jsx` and mounted by `src/content/Content.jsx`.
